  <h1>Eyes Exercise</h1>
    <p>This project is about CSS dynamic styling. At index.html you will find a couple of eyes that follow the cursor position.</p>  
  <h1> Usage and Support </h1>
    <p>The usage of this code is pretty simple, you only have to move the cursor around and you will realize how both eyes are moving.</p>
    <p>The program has only one fat arrow function at eyes.js that tracks the cursor position in order to update the style from eyes.</p>

  <h1> Future improvements </h1>
    <p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Add buttons to start tracking.</li>
        <li>Add a trackable area to prevent whole page cursor tracking.</li>
      </ul>
